# Kids SafeNote Standard

- Always ask for child’s consent and allow a guardian to stay close (visible, in contact, or in the room).
- Use non-medical language: focus on comfort, choices, and rates of pressure (“very gentle,” “slow,” “soft”).
- Provide stop-anytime cues (“If you need a break, just say so,” “We can pause whenever you want”).
- Reinforce that the experience is playful, trusting, and calm; avoid clinical or adult-only phrasing.
- Mention hydration, rest, and the option for guardians to hold hands or stay within reach.
