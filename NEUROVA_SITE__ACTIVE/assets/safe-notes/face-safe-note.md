# Face â€“ Sothys SafeNote Standard

- Always frame face language around sensory comfort, hydration, and luminous calm.
- Explicitly avoid medical claims, diagnostic statements, or â€œbefore/afterâ€ promises.
- Keep the tone nurturing: â€œWe support the skinâ€™s glow,â€ â€œWe honor sensitive zones.â€
- Reference soothing rituals (cool towels, slow breath, gentle palms) instead of cures.
- Mention the importance of sunscreen and gentle movement post-treatment without insisting on results.
