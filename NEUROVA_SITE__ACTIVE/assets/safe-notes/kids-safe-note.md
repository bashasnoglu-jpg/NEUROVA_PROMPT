# Kids SafeNote Standard

- Always ask for childâ€™s consent and allow a guardian to stay close (visible, in contact, or in the room).
- Use non-medical language: focus on comfort, choices, and rates of pressure (â€œvery gentle,â€ â€œslow,â€ â€œsoftâ€).
- Provide stop-anytime cues (â€œIf you need a break, just say so,â€ â€œWe can pause whenever you wantâ€).
- Reinforce that the experience is playful, trusting, and calm; avoid clinical or adult-only phrasing.
- Mention hydration, rest, and the option for guardians to hold hands or stay within reach.
