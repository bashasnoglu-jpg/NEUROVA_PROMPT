## Styleguides

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, etc.).
- Ensure all `<img>` tags have `alt` attributes.
- Use double quotes for attributes.

### CSS

- Use CSS variables for colors and spacing (defined in `:root`).
- Follow the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention where possible (e.g., `.nv-header`, `.nv-link--active`).
- Keep styles in `assets/css/style.css`.

### JavaScript

- Use modern ES6+ syntax (const/let, arrow functions).
- Keep logic in `assets/js/app.js`.
- Ensure code is formatted according to the `.editorconfig` settings.
