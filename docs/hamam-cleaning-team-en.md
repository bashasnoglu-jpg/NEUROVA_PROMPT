# Hamam Team – Post-Program Routine and Cleaning

This guide explains the step-by-step closing process for the hamam team after their shift, covering guest relations wrap-up, defect/damage reporting, and the detailed cleaning workflow.

## 1. Guest Relations – When the Service is Complete
1. Thank the guest and briefly summarize the ritual prepared for them (which mud, which ritual was used).
2. If the guest is satisfied, say a quick "see you soon"; if there are any sensitive points, take notes and inform the manager.
3. If there is any anticipated damage or defect (e.g., damage to the marble basin or stone cladding), send a photo + short note + code (e.g., `HAM_05`) to the WhatsApp/Slack channel.

## 2. Defect & Damage Reporting
- Minor cracks/spalls: first, close off the area and report it with a photo; inform the maintenance team immediately.
- Pool equipment or jacuzzi issues: if a control panel warning is received, shut down the system and enter it into the "maintenance request" form; if a guest is still inside, prepare another room.
- If there is an error with the water/heat regulator, call the technician, log it in the notebook, and offer an alternative room to meet the guest's expectations.

## 3. Detailed Cleaning Workflow
1.  **First Round:** Steam room windows, stone seating areas, porous surfaces, and rope-handled doors are cleaned in order.
2.  **Second Round:** If there is liquid residue on the floors, first dry them, then wipe with a hamam-certified disinfectant.
3.  **Third Round:** The pool edge, shower areas, bathrobe/towel trays, and accessories are wiped down with an antiseptic solution.
4.  **Final Round:** The air purifier and aroma diffuser are checked; herbal materials (bay leaf, lavender, etc.) are replenished and rinsed with fresh water.
5.  A "cleaning complete" tag must be attached at each step, and notes about the room should be entered into digital forms.

## 4. Resources & Sustainability
- Record the quantities of chemicals used; prevent incorrect mixtures.
- Soiled textiles are first placed in red bags, then sent to the laundry.
- After the lighting and water systems are turned off, the area is ventilated; the doors do not remain open until the next guest arrives.
