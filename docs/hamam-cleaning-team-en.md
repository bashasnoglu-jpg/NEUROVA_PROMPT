# Hammam Team – Post-Service Routine and Cleaning

This guide walks the hammam team through the post-service handover: guest communication, defect reporting, and the detailed cleaning flow.

## 1. Guest interaction – when the service ends
1. Thank the guest and briefly summarize the ritual performed (which mud, which rhythm was used).
2. If the guest is satisfied, offer a quick “see you soon”; document any sensitive points and notify the manager.
3. If you spot a potential defect or damage (e.g., stone panel chipped) capture a photo, short note, and code (e.g., `HAM_05`) and send it via WhatsApp/Slack channel.

## 2. Defect & damage reporting
- For small cracks or floor spills: cordon the area, document with a photo, and inform maintenance immediately.
- For pool equipment or jacuzzi issues: if the control panel shows an alert, shut the system down and log a “maintenance request”; provide another room if the guest is still inside.
- If a water/heating regulator error occurs, call the technician, log it in the notebook, and offer an alternative room to keep the guest flow smooth.

## 3. Detailed cleaning flow
1. **First round:** Clean the steam room glass, stone seating, textured surfaces, and rope doors in sequence.
2. **Second round:** If liquids remain on the floors, dry them first, then wipe with hammam-certified disinfectant.
3. **Third round:** Sanitize pool edges, shower areas, towel trays, and accessories with antiseptic solution.
4. **Last round:** Check the air purifier and aroma diffuser; refresh plant materials (laurel, lavender etc.) and rinse with fresh water.
5. Apply the “cleaning complete” tag after each cycle and enter related notes in the digital forms.

## 4. Resources & sustainability
- Record every chemical used with quantities to avoid mixing errors.
- Place soiled textiles into red bags before sending them to the laundry.
- After lights and water systems are off, ventilate the space; keep doors closed until the next guest arrives.

Share this guide at the hammam entrance, cleaning closet, and team WhatsApp group to keep consistency. If you want, I can also prepare an English QA summary version or printable poster next.
