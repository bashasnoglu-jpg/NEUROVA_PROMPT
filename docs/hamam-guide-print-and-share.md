# Hammam Guide – Print, Laminate, and Share Workflow

Follow these steps in order to turn the TR/EN hammam guides into durable cheat sheets and spread them to the SPA crew:

1. **PDF export (TR & EN)**  
   - Open each Markdown file (`docs/hamam-cleaning-team-tr.md`, `docs/hamam-cleaning-team-en.md`) in a Markdown editor (VS Code, Typora, etc.).  
   - Use “Print” → select “Save as PDF” with 12mm margins, Helvetica/Arial 10-11pt, single-column layout.  
   - Name the outputs `Hammam_Cleaning_TR_A4.pdf` and `Hammam_Cleaning_EN_A4.pdf`.

2. **Laminate & place**  
   - Laminate both PDFs at a print shop (matte finish keeps glare down).  
   - Pin the Turkish version near the hamam entry/closet and the English version near the cleaning supply station or manager desk.

3. **Digital backup**  
   - Upload the PDFs to the shared team folder (Drive/OneDrive).  
   - Post a pinned WhatsApp/Slack announcement with QR links to the PDFs and mention QA checklist availability.

4. **Desktop shortcut & quick access**  
   - Create desktop shortcuts named “Hammam Guide (TR)” and “Hammam Guide (EN)” pointing to the shared PDFs.  
   - Add these shortcuts to the cleaning team’s workstation list alongside “Run QA Tests” quick link.

5. **Weekly review reminder**  
   - Every Friday, remind staff to open the guide once and tick off the “Hammam QA checklist” (see the separate “hamam-cleaning-checklist.md” document).  
   - Update the checklist file if safety rules or presets change; rename the PDF if the content version increases (e.g., `v1.0` → `v1.1`).
