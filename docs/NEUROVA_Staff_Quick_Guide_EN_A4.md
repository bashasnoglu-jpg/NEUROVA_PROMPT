# Staff Quick Use + Troubleshooting (A4)

**Purpose:** Keep this single-page sheet close to the workstation so the crew can follow the exact same routine in English.

- Printing tips: 12 mm margins, use `Helvetica/Arial` at 10.5 pt, black & white is fine.
- Export to PDF and print without “fit to page”; laminate if needed.

## 1. Single shortcut files

- Pin two desktop shortcuts:
  1. **NEUROVA Prompt (Usage)** → `http://127.0.0.1:5500/prompt-library.html`
  2. **NEUROVA Prompt (QA / Manager)** → `http://127.0.0.1:5500/prompt-library.html?qa=1`
- Keep names short so staff always open the right mode.

## 2. 30-second start-of-day check

- Each shift confirms three values:
  1. `promptsLen > 0` (do cards show up?)
  2. `packErrors = 0`
  3. Weekly `?qa=1` → “Run QA Tests”
- If all indicators are green (Health & Selftest OK), proceed; otherwise alert technical support immediately.

## 3. “Screen empty? three moves”

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` to hard refresh |
| 2 | Verify the link is `127.0.0.1:5500/prompt-library.html` |
| 3 | Still empty? escalate to manager/IT |

## 4. Role lock keeps consistency

- Lock the role filter to **Reception** on front-desk devices, and **Therapist** on treatment-room devices.
- This prevents staff from wandering into the other role’s prompts and saves time.

## 5. Quick presets by guest type

- Define three preset buttons:
  1. **Jet Lag / Recovery** – energy-balance prompts.
  2. **Deep Relax** – premium calm-focused prompts.
  3. **Kids & Family** – permission-first, quiet/conformity prompts.
- Each button filters the right category/language/role so the team never gets lost in the menu.

## 6. Visible SafeNote reminders

- Kids, Hammam, and Face cards must highlight the SafeNote row (bolded or framed).
- Staff must acknowledge the reminder before proceeding—especially for parental permission and quiet-space rules.

## 7. Naming standard for exports

- Save every asset as `YYYY-MM-DD_CATEGORY_ROLE_LANG_##.jpg`. Example:
  `2025-12-17_REC_Thai_Therapist_TR_01.jpg`
- This keeps archives searchable and audit-ready; flag any misnamed files to the feedback channel.

## 8. Three approval-required areas

- Never publish without sign-off in:
  1. **Kids imagery**
  2. **Signature & Couples**
  3. **Face – Sothys**
- Escalate to a manager before any of these go live.

## 9. Fast feedback channel

- If you spot a bad/inappropriate output: capture the code (e.g., `REC_03`) + screenshot + short note.
- Send everything via the dedicated WhatsApp/Slack channel for same-day correction.

## 10. Version tag footer

- Footer line: `Prompt Library vX.Y | packs: N | QA: PASS`
- This reassures staff they are on the latest dashboard; no more “is this the old page?” moments.
