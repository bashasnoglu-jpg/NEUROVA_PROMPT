# SANTIS Prompt Style Guide (v1.0)

## Quiet Luxury / SANTIS LOOK
- Marble / brass / muted neutrals.
- Ambient diffusion + low-motion pacing.
- Language: "guide", "wrap", "support", "steady"; keep all verbs intention-driven.
- Keep references to signature catalog regions (Recovery, Ayurvedic, Hamam, Seasonal Detox) in the story copy.

## Safe Note Rules
- **Hamam / Kids & Family / Signature / Face – Sothys** require clear safeNotes (see `assets/safe-notes/`).
- Avoid medical claims, before-after promises, or hard clinical language.
- Offer guest choice language: “choose pressure”, “pause anytime”, “guardian nearby”, “hydration reminder”.
- Mirror secure expressions when referencing treatments (close-up kese, steam, kids playfulness).

## Quality & Export
- Run `npm run quality:gate` before every publish; results live in `exports/quality-report.*`.
- Use `npm run export:prompts` to refresh `exports/santis-prompts.*` for catalogs.
- Print panel is meant for quick briefs; open via top-right Print Panel button (A4-friendly header/footer included).

## Reference Assets
- `assets/SANTIS_REFERANS.md` contains the default tone blocks (Hamam kese, kids safe note wording, SANTIS Look reminders).
- Link to this guide when building new packs: `docs/pack-checklist.md` lists required fields + safe note examples.
