# SPA Cleaning Team – Work Checks and Guest Relations

This guide explains the **sequential routine** for the spa cleaning team: pre-shift checks, cleaning flow, guest engagement, and reporting.

## 1. Start-of-shift work check (in order)
1. **Review:** Read the previous shift’s notes in the logbook; note any outstanding requests or issues and confirm follow-up.
2. **Equipment check:** Confirm cleaning machines, disinfectants, mops, towels, and supplies are stocked and functional; alert maintenance if anything fails.
3. **Area walkthrough:** Walk the spa entrance, lockers, and treatment rooms; inspect visible dirt/grime in sequence.
4. **Daily log:** Record each step briefly in the digital tracker or notebook; report any missing items to management.

## 2. Cleaning process (before and after the guest)
- **Before the guest arrives (30 minutes before check-in):**
  - Wipe the spa entrance, reservation board, and waiting area with wet/dry mops in order.
  - Ensure treatment rooms have SafeNote rules visible, towel/robe sets, and aromatherapy devices ready.
  - If “Jet Lag / Recovery,” “Deep Relax,” or “Kids & Family” presets are active, pay attention to the related cards and adjust routes immediately if the guest changes focus.
- **After the guest departs:**
  - Check every room’s waste bin; if liquids spilled, dry the floor first, then disinfect.
  - Clean surfaces (tables, side tables, panel knobs) sequentially with antiseptic.
  - Place towels/mats in vacuum-ready area and separate used items in red disposal bags.
  - Mark the room as cleaned with the “cleaning complete” tag.

## 3. Guest relations and communication
- **Welcoming:** Smile, try to remember the guest’s name, and say “We prepared a clean, fresh space for your service today.”
- **Issues:** If a guest is unhappy, listen patiently, report the code (e.g., `REC_03`), and propose a calm solution without raising your voice.
- **Guidance:** Show the small cards that explain Kids/Hammam/Face rules; direct the guest only after approvals are in place.
- **Fast feedback channel:** For missing materials or hazards, send code + photo + short note through the shared WhatsApp/Slack channel.

## 4. End-of-shift cleaning/report
- Log the following in the digital form or notebook:
  - Daily cleaning log (what was cleaned and which rooms were used)
  - Chemicals and quantities used
  - Manager-approved checklist (three approval points: Kids, Signature, Face)
- Send the entire report to the morning team lead; remind the team about the weekly “Run QA Tests” link for QA.

## 5. Consistency and improvement
- Place the “cleaning control shortcut” (desktop link) near the workstation and use it to quickly review in 30 seconds:
  - SafeNote visibility at the entrance, guest flow, and preset alignment—go through them in order.
- Update the document with manager feedback; add new guest relations notes and share them with the crew.

Post this guide as a pinned message in Slack/WhatsApp and print it as an A4 poster near the spa entrance to boost consistency. I can create a laminated bilingual version if you’d like next.
