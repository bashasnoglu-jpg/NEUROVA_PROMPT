# SANTIS Exec Brief (2025-12-20)
- Keep 24-48h watch window; do not change copy or CTA placement.
- Validate Products -> Value vs Entry clicks via heatmap export after the watch window.
- Confirm WA number consistency between `wa-config.js` and Products hero `wa.me` links.
- Fix EN source collision by setting `data-page="packages"` on `SANTIS_SITE/packages.html`.
- Update tracker to honor `data-source` so CTA intent is attributable beyond page-level source.
- Prefer v2 key reads in heatmap overlay to avoid legacy masking.
- Run cleanup dry-run to assess legacy key volume; apply merge only if needed.
- Keep Value copy as-is; only consider Premium micro-polish if Value lift is clear.
- If Value is flat, tune WA conversation flow instead of changing copy.
- Document tool output issue (`signals-top-files`) and update the reporting script.
- Plan retirement of legacy `nv_wa_click_` keys after v2 stabilizes.
- Add a lightweight server-side WA click capture in the medium term for durable analytics.
