# Face – Sothys SafeNote Standard

- Always frame face language around sensory comfort, hydration, and luminous calm.
- Explicitly avoid medical claims, diagnostic statements, or “before/after” promises.
- Keep the tone nurturing: “We support the skin’s glow,” “We honor sensitive zones.”
- Reference soothing rituals (cool towels, slow breath, gentle palms) instead of cures.
- Mention the importance of sunscreen and gentle movement post-treatment without insisting on results.
